#!/bin/bash

#The first line is always #!/bin/bash in a bash file because this line defines that you are going to run the script under bash environment

#and using hash(#)we can write the comments.

#we can write any string when we echo within double quotes or directly, both works.
echo "Hello World"


echo My name is Ashish

#just remember we need to add executable permisssion to our bash file just run this - chmod a+x ./file_name.sh

#then we can run bash file by writing - ./file_name.sh
